# Readable
## Udacity React Nanodegree Project 

This is the starter project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local simulator for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine. You can use npm to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
